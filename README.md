### TASK 1
   Functionality:
   1. User Input: 
      - `num = int(input("Enter the number: "))` -> Takes a number from the user and converts it to an integer.
   
   2. Even/Odd Check: 
      - ` if num % 2 == 0` -> If the remainder when dividing by 2 is 0, the number is even.
      - `else` -> the number is odd.
   
   3. Output: 
      - If the number is even, it prints:  
        `"X is an even number."`  
      - If the number is odd, it prints:  
        `"X is an odd number."`


### TASK 2
     
   Functionality :
   1. Initialize the Sum Variable:  
      - `sum = 0` -> Starts with `sum` set to 0, ready to accumulate values.
   
   2. Loop from 1 to 50:
      - `for i in range(1, 51):` -> Iterates from 1 to 50 (since `range(1,51)` excludes 51).
      - `sum += i` -> Adds each number in the range to `sum`.
   
   3. Print the Total Sum: 
      - `print( "The sum of the number from 1 to 50 is :",sum)` -> Displays the final sum of numbers from 1 to 50.
